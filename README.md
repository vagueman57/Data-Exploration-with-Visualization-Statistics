# Data-Exploration-with-Visualization-Statistics
This project explores the fundamental concepts of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) by applying various techniques across multiple datasets using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. EDA is a crucial step in data science that helps understand dataset structure, detect anomalies, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights. This project covers data preprocessing, visualization, statistical analysis, feature exploration, and correlation analysis, making it a valuable resource for beginners and professionals aiming to improve their data analysis skills. The analysis includes:

✅ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Handling missing values, outlier detection, and formatting.
✅ Descriptive Statistics – Summary statistics, mean, median, standard deviation, and IQR(Interquartile range).
✅ Data Visualization – Histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and correlation heatmaps.
✅ Feature Engineering & Selection – Identifying important features for modelling.
✅ Correlation & Relationship Analysis – Understanding dependencies between features.
